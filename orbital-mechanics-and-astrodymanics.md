# Intuition for orbital mechanics & astrodynamics

- Orbit velocity and orbiting altitude
- Orbits are never perfectly circular (elliptical orbit)
- Periapsis (closest to orbiting body), apoapsis (furthest from orbiting body); in context of earth: Perigee and apogee
- Mechanical energy ($E$): Kinetic energy ($KE$) and gravitational potential ($U$) energy: $E = KE + U = \frac{1}{2} m \vec{V}^{2} + m g h$
- Prograde burn and retrograde burn: Burn vectors are parallel with the direction of motion; affect orbit altitude
- Prograde burn: Fire engines in direction, burns are periapsis and apoapsis increase (elliptical) orbit
- Retrograde burn: Fire engines in opposite direction, burns are periapsis and apoapsis decrease (elliptical) orbit
- Radial out burn and radial in burn: Burn vectors are orthogonal to the direction of motion; does not add velocity to orbit; shifts orbit around orbiting body
- Normal and anti normal burn: Burn vectors are perpendicular to the direction of motion; orbit slowly rotates with center of rotation being orbiting body (_inclination change_); extremely costly maneuver, usually only used foe corrections/matching orbit of another spacecraft

## Phasing maneuver

- Essentially two Hohmann transfers
- Hohmann transfer: Highly fuel efficient, two-impulse maneuver used to move a spacecraft between two coplanaer, circular orbits of different radii
- Applies burns at periapsis and apoapsis, utilizes and elliptical transfer orbit to shift altitude with minimal propellant
- Changes the size of an orbit twice - first from original into a different orbit, then back into original orbit
- Purpose: Get spacecraft to a point in the original orbit at a different time
- Generally used for rendezvous between two spacecraft

## Gravity assist

- A celestial body's gravitational pull is used to alter the trajectory and velocity of a spacecraft
- Can be modeled as a conservation of momentum equation
- Useful for increasing speed of a spacecraft beyond what it would have been otherwise capable of

## Bi-elliptic transfer

- Similar to Hohmann transfer but uses two elliptical transfer orbits instead of one
- More effective than Hohmann transfer when ratio of the final orbit radius to the initial orbit radius is large

## Patched conics transfer

- Problem is broken down into multiple two body problems
- Maneuver that requires a hyperbolic exit, and elliptic transfer, and a hyperbolic arrival
- Spacecraft must be going fast enough to leave Earth's sphere of influence

## Unlock spacecraft orientation
## B-plane targeting
## J2 perturbations
## Low earth orbit lifetime
