# Orbital basics

- [ ] Explain how early space explorers contributed to our understanding of orbits
- [ ] Understand Newton’s three basic laws of motion and how they apply to orbits
- [ ] Explain and use Newton’s Universal Law of Gravitation
- [ ] Use the two constants of orbital motion – specific mechanical energy and specific angular momentum, to explain basic properties of orbits
- [ ] Combine these laws to develop the two-body equation of motion
- [ ] Integrate the two-body equation of motion (optional)

## Review: vector mathematics, trigonometry and calculus

**Vector notation**

- _Scalar_ is a quantity (has magnitude only; **does not** have an arrow)
- _Vector_ is a quantity that has magnitude and direction (**denoted with an arrow**)
- _Unit vector_ is a vector with a magnitude of one (determines direction only)
- Vectors can be resolved into components: $\vec{F} = \vec{F_{x}} + \vec{F_{y}} + \vec{F_{z}}$
- $\vec{F} = \vec{F_{x}}\widehat{I} + \vec{F_{y}}\widehat{J} + \vec{F_{z}}\widehat{K}$, where $\widehat{I}, \widehat{J}, \widehat{K}$ are the unit vectors in the x-, y-, and z-directions

**Vector operations**

- The _magnitude of a vector_ is the scalar part of a vector
- If $\vec{R} = R_{I}\widehat{I} + R_{J}\widehat{J} + R_{K}\widehat{K}$, then $|\vec{R}| = R = \sqrt{R_{I}^{2}\widehat{I} + R_{J}^{2}\widehat{J} + R_{K}^{2}\widehat{K}}$

**Dot products**
